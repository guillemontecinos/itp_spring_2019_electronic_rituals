Aries (March 21-April 19)
Today when talking to others, you want to get down to the nitty-gritty. You want the bottom line. You don’t want to waste time on superficial chitchat about the weather. (Lately, conversation about the weather is not so superficial, is it?)

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
Today and tomorrow the Moon is traveling through your Money House. This gives you strong feelings of attachment to whatever you own. You’ll be upset to lose or damage something. Because of this unconscious attitude, it’s not a great time to shop for pricey things.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Today the moon is in your sign, which gives you a stronger need to belong and relate to others. You feel sensitive to the feelings and moods of people around you, yet ironically, you might be more emotionally demanding. “Who me? You talking to me?”

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
For the next two days, the moon is hiding in your chart, which in turn gives you an urge to withdraw from the busy-ness of everything around you. You won’t feel like socializing. Instead, you will prefer solitude with carrot cake.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Your emotional contact with others is more important today and tomorrow because of the placement of the moon. This is why you feel more protective and supportive to others. You have an urge to bond with friends and show them that you care.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
Once a month, for two days, the moon is at the top of your chart. That’s happening right now, which is why you are conspicuous. It also makes other people talk about you or know personal details about your private life. (Whaat?)

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
Today and tomorrow you want to get away from your daily routine and do something different. Ideally, you might travel. But at the least, you can be a tourist in your own city and go someplace you’ve never been before to satisfy your desire for discovery and stimulation!

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
You will feel more intense than usual today and tomorrow because of the placement of the moon. You might also attract intense people to you. (“Hi Darth.”) You might feel more possessive about property, especially something you share with someone else.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
Today and tomorrow the moon is opposite your sign, which means you have to go more than halfway when dealing with others. (That’s just how it works and it happens two days every month.) However, if you get into conflict with someone, it will be more emotional! Oh yeah.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
This is a busy, fast-paced time for you because you have a full agenda. Nevertheless, today and tomorrow, you might have to slow down because you have to put the interests of someone else before your own. You cannot escape this self-denying situation. Just accept it.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
Yay! Today and tomorrow heightens your interest in the arts, socializing with others, enjoying sports events and having fun with playful activities with kids. Romance will be blessed. You want to have a good time!

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
You might want to withdraw from the busy-ness of the world around you today and tomorrow as the moon travels through the bottom of your chart. After all, with the sun in your sign now, you have been out there flying your colors, which means even you need to take a breather. (Or at least do your laundry.)

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Today you have strong opinions about financial matters or about something that you own. Initially, you might have a possessive fixation, which halts you from using it. Slowly, you will see an application or a use for whatever it is, which leads to a more practical way of doing something.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
Today the moon is in your sign, making aspects to five different planets. For the most part, this is a good thing, but it does make you feel feisty! Ultimately, you want to make some wise choices, and perhaps future plans about travel and further education. Actually, this is a good day to do this!

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
You might be doing a slow boil about something but feel that you can’t speak up. (Grrr.) If this is the case, say nothing because the only substitute for the truth is a lie. Meanwhile, opportunities in publishing, the media or something to do with medicine or the law look promising!

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
You have high energy today when dealing with friends and groups. This is why you might be involved in a competitive relationship with someone, perhaps a female. Or you might attract some competition to you? Discussions with others will be lively (and that’s putting it mildly).

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
You’ll be forceful when dealing with bosses, parents, teachers and VIPs today. Oh yes, others will notice you and see the stance that you are taking. You have definite opinions, which is why you will trigger a strong response from someone else.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
Be careful during controversial discussions because you’re ready to stick your neck out today. You have strong beliefs and feelings about matters related to philosophy, religion, race or politics. You have decided to stand your ground, which will provoke others to do the same thing as well. (Oops.)

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
You’ll have no trouble defending your own best interests about shared property, insurance disputes or discussions about wills and inheritances because you have strong, personal feelings about these matters. You will be possessive about what you think is yours.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
Discussions with partners and close friends will be intense and lively today. (You might have such a serious fight that in the middle of it, a hockey game breaks out!) Expect to attract feisty people to you today. Pull in your reins to avoid conflict.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
You might be a tad aggressive at work today. Guard against impulsive reactions or angry outbursts while everyone is opinionated because fiery Mars is lined up with the moon, which makes everyone ready to speak their mind! Oh yeah!

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
Parents must be patient with their kids today because it’s easy to lose it. Likewise, romantic partners must be patient with each other. However, this feisty energy that fills the air can also translate into wonderful, creative productivity if it’s channeled right.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
Avoid domestic arguments today. People are cranky, impulsive and quick to make snarky remarks. That’s because a personal hurt or some suppressed rage will leak out today. (Boo!) This won’t happen if you maintain a mellow, easygoing style, but the repressed anger will still be there.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
Don’t be too pushy when talking to others today because that will trigger arguments. Instead, channel this intense focus into writing, sales, acting or teaching while your intellectual energy is high. “I’m on a roll!” Good day to make future plans because you’re so determined.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
You might want to use your possessions or money to help someone today, especially someone who is less fortunate. You feel genuine sympathy for others and you feel fortunate for what you have and who you are. (Ain’t it the truth?)

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
Today fiery Mars is in your sign dancing with Neptune. This helps you to see the world around you with greater sensitivity. You will appreciate the needs of your friends and neighbors and be more inclined to help them. In fact, you will feel fulfilled if you have an opportunity to do so.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
It will be easy for you to put your needs second to the needs of others today, especially for someone who is suffering. It’s easy to forget it but the truth is there is nothing more rewarding or more fulfilling than helping someone in need.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
If you get a chance to work in a charitable organization today or a hospital or any institution for the disadvantaged, you will feel rewarded and gratified. You’ll feel good to use your energy and strength to help others in need or to make their lives better.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
If you are in a position to use your power and influence, or to influence someone else in power so that they in turn can help others, this will please you. Your altruism is aroused today, which means you want to do good in any capacity that presents itself.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
You will enjoy being surrounded by beauty today if you can swing this. Perhaps you can visit museums or an art gallery or beautiful architectural buildings? You might also enjoy a drive in the country or visiting the park. Indulge this artistic sensitivity if you can.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
If you have to make decisions about inheritances or wills or you have to divide or share something with someone today, you will be more than generous. In fact, if you are dealing with someone who is less fortunate than you, you will be generous because you appreciate what it’s like to walk a mile in someone else’s wedgies.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
Although recently, you might have been annoyed with partners and close friends, today you feel softer towards them. You feel less judgmental and kinder. This is good because you feel better, and of course, if you feel better, they will feel better as well.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
You want to make the world a better place today. If you are at work, you will be kinder and more receptive to co-workers and customers. If you are doing other things, you will be sensitive to the needs of those around you. This creates a win/win situation because it makes you feel good, too.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
Romantic relationships will be tender and affectionate today. In addition, those of you involved with children will feel very caring and tenderhearted to the kids and want to help them in any way. It’s a lovely day to schmooze and socialize!

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
You will feel gratified if you can help a family member today. After all, family is gold. Don’t hesitate to use your energy, your time, your effort or your resources to help someone you love.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
You might gain some new insights today because you are seeing the world through new eyes. And of course, as many teachers have said, when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Don’t get your belly in a rash when talking to parents, bosses, VIPs and the police today because you might be tempted. It will not behoove you to mouth off at anyone. (Believe me.) Therefore, guard against knee-jerk reactions, even if you’re annoyed. Stay chill.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
You might be doing a slow boil about something today. You’re not happy but you feel you can’t speak up because you’ll sound petty or it will be inappropriate. (Yeah, you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place.) Fortunately, you are someone who waits to choose your time to speak.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Don’t get embroiled in an argument with a friend or a member of a group today because it’s just not worth it. This is also a poor day to volunteer for anything or to try to redo anything that’s important. Check the Moon Alert above. Easy does it.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
Avoid arguments with parents, bosses and the police today because they could be nasty. Furthermore, you will not achieve anything because for most of this day, it’s a Moon Alert, which means whatever you initiate will just fade off into the ether. Be smart.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Avoid touchy subjects like politics, religion and race today because you’ll get in trouble. You might go head-to-head with someone in a nasty way. You might have big travel plans today or be hopeful about a legal outcome.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
Disputes about shared property, inheritances and wills might arise today. You might also be tempted to give away too much money. Whatever the case, this is actually a poor day for financial decisions. Postpone big decisions until Monday.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
This is a tricky day because for most of this day, there is a Moon Alert. (See above.) People are excitable and quick to argue, so keep this in mind. It’s also easy to be too optimistic about something or overextend yourself. Don’t promise more than you can deliver.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
Do not make suggestions about improvements and reforms at work today. Don’t tell someone how they can do something better because it could trigger resentment or an argument. Avoid big plans today; wait until Monday. Check the Moon Alert above.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
Romantic couples must be patient with each other today because jealousy and a tendency to argue are lurking beneath the surface. Likewise, parents must be patient with their kids. And yet, fun times and exuberant occasions are also possible. It’s a tricky day. (See Moon Alert.)

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
You might have big ideas about how to make home improvements today; however, someone might not agree. Don’t push issues today because arguments can arise. It’s also easy to overestimate something. In addition, today is a Moon Alert! (Wait until Monday to act.) Oy vey.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
Do not promise more than you can deliver to anyone today although you might be tempted to do so. Furthermore, do not be quick to jump into an argument to try to prove your point. It’s not worth it. Because of the Moon Alert today, just coast. Restrict spending to food and gas.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
This is a poor day to spend money on anything other than food, gas or entertainment. Guard your possessions and your cash against loss and theft. Don’t make financial promises or agreements — wait until Monday. You’ll be glad you did. Check the Moon Alert above.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
This is an excellent day to do research because you have the energy for this. Your mind will be steady and focused and will pay attention to detail. You will be very productive because you have the patience and endurance to finish what you begin.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
You can benefit from others today, especially older people or people who are more experienced than you. Listen to their advice because you can learn something. (After all, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Why not stand on the shoulders of those who have done this before?)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Bosses and authority figures will be impressed with you today because you are diligent and productive. Whatever you do, you will have a serious, respectful attitude and care about the results. You have the wisdom to see the long-range benefits of the effort you put out today.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
You’ll find it easy to study today or finish important papers because you will stay focused on the job. Likewise, you can finish writing projects connected with publishing and the media. Work connected with medical or legal matters will be productive.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Recently, you have been focused on red-tape issues connected with wills, inheritances, shared property and insurance. Today will be an exceptionally productive day for you to finish this kind of work. Listen to the advice of someone who is more experienced.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
This is the perfect day to sit down with a spouse, partner or close friend and have a serious, practical discussion about the division of labour or how to share expenses. People will be receptive to doing this, which means you will make strides. Try it!

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
Some Fridays make people want to slack off — however, not this Friday. Quite the opposite. You will be productive at work today because you are focused, energetic and conscientious. You won’t overlook details and you’ll finish what you begin. Bravo!

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
This is a productive day to practice or hone your skills, especially if you are in the arts. Whether you need to play arpeggios and scales or memorize your lines or perfect your painting technique, you will have the patience to do so. It’s also a good day to practice for sports events or to teach kids.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
Listen to the advice of an older family member today because what they have to say will likely benefit you. You will see ways to strengthen, repair and solidify your home base today, which will be helpful! You might also be in a position to give sensible advice to a family member.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
You have an orderly state of mind today, which will allow you to make concrete plans and execute them in a practical way. Whatever you do, you will do carefully with no loose ends. Your powers of concentration are great and you won’t overlook anything. (I’m impressed.)

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
You will be frugal and practical with your money today whether this is regarding your personal spending habits or business decisions. Above all, you will avoid waste and loss. You will be very careful in decisions regarding spending money.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
It’s easy to demonstrate self-discipline today because you’re in the right frame of mind. For example, you’re prepared to defer your present gratification and wait for another day for your rewards. This is why you will choose to work and accomplish as much as possible today.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
This month, Mercury is retrograde, which will create confusion in your world; however, for your sign in particular, it will help you do research and discover answers from the past. If you’re looking for solutions to old problems, dig in!

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
This month you will run into old friends and hear from people from the past, especially from organizations and clubs to which you have belonged. Make the most of this chance to reacquaint yourself with old contacts because it’s good to have a history with others.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
This month you will be in contact with parents you haven’t seen for a while or you might run into bosses and authority figures, perhaps a teacher or a professor. This could be an inspirational, exciting moment or it could be a bummer. Who knows?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
This month is the perfect time to finish your book, your screenplay, your thesis, a school paper or any major study project that has been lingering forever. Now you will plow through work, study and research with surprising ease!

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
This is the perfect month to wrap up details regarding wills, inheritances, taxes, debt and anything to do with shared property or the wealth and assets of your partner. It will be easy to do this work, even if you’ve been dreading it.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
Ex-partners and old friends from your past are back in your world. This could be an opportunity for closure or clarification. Or you might want to hide and pretend you don’t see them. (Just in case, look fantastic when you go because living well is the best revenge.)

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
This month your work is plagued by silly mistakes, misplaced paperwork, mixed-up communications and problems with equipment, computers, cell phones, late deliveries and lost mail. Give yourself extra time so you have wiggle room to deal with these frustrating delays.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
Old flames are back in your life, which could be thrilling and exciting or scary. It all depends on how the relationship ended. Parents might have a recurring problem or a recurring situation with their kids. Perhaps this time it can be resolved?

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
Stock the fridge because relatives will be camped on your doorstep and sleeping on your sofa this month. You might welcome this initially, but after a few days, the novelty of visitors wears thin. Especially your wisecracking brother-in-law.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
Transportation delays, car problems, missed buses and trains plus mixed-up communications will be frustrating this month. Just when you need it, your cell phone will die, your car won’t start or you will have a flat tire. This is a wicked Mercury retrograde for Capricorns.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
If you’re looking for work, return to places you’ve worked at or applied before because your chances will be better. Meanwhile, financial matters, even your paycheck, might be delayed this month. This month is a poor time to open a new business but a good time to finish old business.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
This month Mercury is retrograde in your sign, which means you will experience delays and mixed-up situations. You might confuse an appointment or be waiting at the wrong place at the wrong time. Try to clarify everything. Slow down and double check everything. Easy does it.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Today is a New Moon, and at different times, both the sun and the moon are lined up with Neptune. In a weird way, this can make you second-guess yourself. You might doubt your abilities to do something. Don’t take this seriously because it’s a temporary confusion.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
It’s easy to idealize a friend today or a member of a group. Your admiration might even instill a desire in you to emulate this person or to change your goals so that you follow in their footsteps. This might be a good idea — but it might not be.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
You might want to present a certain image of yourself to others today, especially bosses and parents. You might strive to be something that you hope to be, or it might just be an act. Conversely, someone might present this sort of thing to you. It’s a tricky day.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
Because your appreciation of beauty is heightened today, give yourself a chance to enjoy beautiful places and beautiful things. Visit art galleries, museums, beautiful boutique shops or pristine parks because you will be inspired by the creativity of others.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Avoid making important financial decisions today, especially if you are giving away money or sharing something. Your ideals are inspired and, because of this, you might be tempted to give away the farm. Generosity is a good thing, but you must act when you are clear and know what you’re doing. Today is fuzzy.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
You might over-idealize a partner or close friend today, or they might see you in the same idealistic way, which can be flattering, but it is unrealistic. Therefore, think very carefully before you agree to anything important so that you do not end up with regrets.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
You might be inspired to help a co-worker today or someone you encounter through your job. Or this same astrological influence might instead make you feel world-weary and overwhelmed by the tasks that you face. Don’t worry because this is a fleeting influence.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
Today you are in touch with your muse and your creative vibes, which is why you might have imaginative ideas about artistic projects. You might also feel sympathetic to the needs of children. Meanwhile, romance will be the stuff of movies — which could be an illusion.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
You will want to help a family member today if you can because you feel genuinely sympathetic to their needs. You might also want to plan some kind of family occasion that is a bonding, heartwarming event because your idealism is aroused.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
Don’t worry if you spend a lot of time daydreaming today or being lost in a fantasy world because it’s very easy to do this today. In discussions with others, clarify what they are saying because it’s easy to misread people today.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
Be careful shopping today because you will be tempted to spend too much money on elegant, luxurious items. Later you might wonder why you even bought them? (Five ostrich boas? One, yes — but five?) Keep your receipts.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
This is a good day to take a realistic look in the mirror and check out the image you create on your world. What can you do to create a better impression? When people meet you, they immediately size you up — never underestimate this. You never get a second chance to make a first impression.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Generally, you’re first in line. You get the first word and the last, because there’s no moss growing on you! Today, however, you prefer to step back and work alone or behind the scenes because it just feels better. You want to keep a low profile.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)
You’re keen to interact with others today, especially friends or members of groups. You will identify with someone and be ready to sympathize with their situation, which is why you might have a heart-to-heart talk. You might also be involved with a group today.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Whether you choose it or not, people notice you today, especially bosses and parents. Do take note because this also includes the police. (Good to know.) You’ll find you carry extra authority in whatever you do or say.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
As a rule, you are a nester, which means you generally travel for a reason — business, family or a special occasion. Today, however, you want to do something different. You want some stimulation and a chance to learn something new! You want to meet new faces.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
You are gung-ho now to achieve your mission (whatever it is) because fiery Mars is at the top of your chart arousing your ambition. Today your focus is on shared property, taxes, debt, insurance, wills and inheritances. We try to ignore it, but all that red-tape stuff never goes away on its own.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)
Because the moon today is opposite your sign, you have to be more accommodating than usual when dealing with others. Be prepared to go more than halfway. This doesn’t mean you’re giving up anything or “losing” — it is simply skillful means on your part.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)
Look around you to see what you can do to work more efficiently and run your life more smoothly. Start with small things. It’s funny how little things like making your bed or doing your laundry give you the impetus to tackle bigger tasks with confidence. (The reverse is true, too.)

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)
This is a playful, fun-loving day, which means you need to get out and socialize! Enjoy fun activities with children. Be open to romantic flirtations and meeting others. Be patient with partners and close friends because Mars is opposite your sign. (By April this is over for another two years.)

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)
No sign more than you likes to be outdoors. You love to have sky overhead. Today, however, you might want to cocoon at home because it suits your needs. Maybe you need a breather? Maybe your home situation demands your attention?

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)
Make a point of talking to others today, especially neighbors, relatives and siblings, because you need to enlighten others about something. You have something you want to say and you need an audience! Yada, yada, yada.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)
“There’s money in them thar hills!” Money, financial discussions, earnings, cash flow and shopping are a strong focus for you today. With respect to your financial deals, remember that this year your interaction with others will actually benefit you. Keep this in mind.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)
Wow — the sun, the moon, Mercury retrograde and your ruler Neptune are all in your sign! This means the entire world is having a Pisces hit. (Surely there is a great shoe sale somewhere.) Ask for what you want because you just might get it!
