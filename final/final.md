## Final - Cartographic Oracle
For the final project I wanted to explore how memories are anchored to places, and how that unique experiential relationship defines –in certain way– our identity. This was the starting point for the development of `Cartographic Oracle`, in collaboration with [Marcela Mancino](https://mardefronteira.wordpress.com/).

Cartographic Oracle is a web site that promts visitors to connect on of their memories with the location it took place, andfrom there answer a question. Along it's interface the web switches the question-answer pipeline of traditional oracles, into a location-memory-question-answer in which the answer is not deterministic but a place where to look for answers.
