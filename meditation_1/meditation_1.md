## Ritual

Attending to a football match and supporting a team consists in a ritual in which the attendant is engaged with sort of ideology related with the team values and a bunch of prejudices and hateful links with supporters of other teams and even of the same team.

Football most of the time is a rude space which reflects the violence of the society in which it is experienced.

In this ritual you are invited to support Colo - Colo in a match agains it's *archrival* Universidad de Chile [Context of historical hateful situations in match between Colo Colo and la U]. This ritual can only be successful if you don't use a violent or misogenic language.
