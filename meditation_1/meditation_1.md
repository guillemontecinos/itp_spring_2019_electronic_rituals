# Meditation 1

## Background

According with Juan Fernando Rivera and his article [El fútbol como ritual](https://cuadrivio.net/el-futbol-como-ritual/) football is a social phenomenon that can clearly be qualified as a ritual according with Turner's definition of a ritual. When a football match is played, everyday life gets disrupted both for players, supporters, neighbors of the stadium, police, at the same time that the stadium is a defined temporal-space framework were symbolic gestures and words are uttered the attendants. Football itself is a ritual but the sub-ritual that mostly calls my attention is ritual of supporting the team as a fan –surely because is the role I have played in the football ritual for the last 15 years.

## Ritual

Attending to a football match and supporting a team consists in a ritual in which the attendant is engaged with sort of ideology related with the team values and a bunch of prejudices and hateful links with supporters of other teams and even of the same team.

Football most of the time is a rude space which reflects the violence of the society in which it is experienced.

In this ritual you are invited to support Colo - Colo in a match agains it's *archrival* Universidad de Chile [Context of historical hateful situations in match between Colo Colo and la U]. This ritual can only be successful if you don't use a violent or misogenic language.
