## Background

According with Juan Fernando Rivera and his article *[El fútbol como ritual](https://cuadrivio.net/el-futbol-como-ritual/)*, football is a social phenomenon that can be clearly qualified as a ritual under Turner's definition of a ritual. When a football match is played, everyday life gets disrupted both for players, supporters, neighbors of the stadium, police. At the same time that the stadium is a defined temporal-space framework were symbolic gestures and words are uttered the attendants. Football itself is a ritual but the sub-ritual that mostly calls my attention is the ritual of supporting the team as a fan –surely because is the role I have played in the football ritual for the last 15 years.

In South America football plays a significant role in social dynamics –hardly understandable by other cultures– because in most of our countries football is a place where the left behind can find a shelter to express theirselves and where they can belong to. But these expressions are most of the time anger and hateful manifestations against an other –which probably occupies the same place in the society but supports the arch-rival team. This has converted football into a dangerous ritual, where hooligans theft *brethren*, fight against the police and their rivals.

## The Ritual

Attending to a football match and supporting a team consists in a ritual in which the attendant is engaged with sort of ideology related with the team values and a bunch of prejudices and hateful links with supporters of other teams and even of the same team.

Football most of the time is a rude space which reflects the violence of the society in which it is experienced.

In this ritual you are invited to support Colo - Colo in a match agains it's *arch-rival* Universidad de Chile [Context of historical hateful situations in match between Colo Colo and la U]. This ritual can only be successful if you don't use a violent or misogenic language.
