## Week 2 - Ritual and Society

We belong to a technologized society that thinks itself as truthful and deterministic, because the narrative of the western side of the world has moved from shamans to doctors and scientists, and from gods to algorithms. That narrative –which exists in an imaginary layer of reality– intends to define our behavior without total success because by the end of the day humans keep making decision based on magic and superstition.

It's interesting how that deterministic ideal struggles with our intuition or with certain magic situations that lead us to make decisions like –for example– when I wore the same shirt at the stadium for an entire year just because the first time I wore it the football team I support won. I just can think superstition drove that behavior because I certainly knew that no matter what cloth I wore the match result won't be affected by me. Yet it's still pretty interesting, even more with technology because we know that circuits are driven by physic's laws but no by god's laws, so it's pointless to lean to one side when the car is turning in a race game because it won't *turn better*.

But there should be something attached to a social heritage that makes us believe in magic. In certain cases it can be related with syncretism due the colonization and imposition of western culture over pre-colombus cultures in America –talking of America as continent. Probably –and I'm speculating with this– that magical heritage is what leads us to search rituals in foreign religions to fulfill a gap that determinism can't address.

## Week 3 - Meditation 1

### Background

According with Juan Fernando Rivera and his article *[El fútbol como ritual](https://cuadrivio.net/el-futbol-como-ritual/)*, football is a social phenomenon that can be clearly qualified as a ritual under Turner's definition of a ritual. When a football match is played, everyday life gets disrupted both for players, supporters, neighbors of the stadium, police. At the same time that the stadium is a defined temporal-space framework were symbolic gestures and words are uttered the attendants. Football itself is a ritual but the sub-ritual that mostly calls my attention is the ritual of supporting the team as a fan –surely because is the role I have played in the football ritual for the last 15 years.

In South America football plays a significant role in social dynamics –hardly understandable by other cultures– because in most of our countries football is a place where the left behind can find a shelter to express theirselves and where they can belong to. But these expressions are most of the time anger and hateful manifestations against an otherness – others which probably occupies the same place in the society but supports the arch-rival team. This has converted football into a dangerous ritual, where hooligans theft *brethren*, fight against the police and their rivals.

In the above video, supporters of the Argentinian team River Plate attack the bus in which the players of their rival team Boca Juniors are transported. This was December 2018 at the Final of the Copa Libertadores –the most important football championship in South America– which finally was suspended. As can be seen, River's supporters play a role in which they hate Boca's players and fans so much that they even can attack them.

### The Ritual

This ritual is about supporting a team and is called "Alentar al Colo" (Support Colo Colo). Attending a football match and supporting a team consists in a ritual in which the attendant is engaged with sort of ideology related with the team values and a bunch of prejudices and hateful links with supporters, players, and even workers of other teams. Football is most of the time a rude and macho space which reflects the violence, misogyny and economic segregation of the society in which it is experienced.

In this ritual the participant is invited to support Colo - Colo –the most popular Chilean football club in a match agains it's *arch-rival* Universidad de Chile. This match has a long history of violence which is expressed in the language that supporters use to refer opponent, full of misogynic terms related with the mother. But the ritual can only be successful if you don't use a violent, misogynic or homophobic language.

[Speech Recognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) was used for the design of the ritual as a tool that allows to detect and write down the words are uttered by the ritual performer. The text was analyzed in terms of detecting if a banned word was said by the performer in order to decide if the ritual can be successfully completed. Additionally, by using the [Iframe API for YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) the video of the football match is displayed in the back of the screen in order to create the proper space-temporal conditions to perform the ritual.

As a ritual, it has not a clear effect in the real life space in which it is performed, but it can be called a banning-style ritual because can't be completed if some rule are violated, in this case the rule of not using a violent or misogynic language. I think it's important to remark that the way of building a better society by banning negative behaviors is not wrong, specially in the regard of discrimination of minorities by violent language usage.
