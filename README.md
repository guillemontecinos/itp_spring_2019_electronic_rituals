# Week 2: Ritual and Society

We belong to a technologized society that thinks itself as truthful and deterministic, because the narrative of the western side of the world has moved from shamans to doctors and scientists, and from gods to algorithms. That narrative –which exists in an imaginary layer of reality– intends to define our behavior without total success because by the end of the day humans keep making decision based on magic and superstition.

It's interesting how that deterministic ideal struggles with our intuition or with certain magic situations that lead us to make decisions like –for example– when I wore the same shirt at the stadium for an entire year just because the first time I wore it the football team I support won. I just can think superstition drove that behavior because I certainly knew that no matter what cloth I wore the match result won't be affected by me. Yet it's still pretty interesting, even more with technology because we know that circuits are driven by physic's laws but no by god's laws, so it's pointless to lean to one side when the car is turning in a race game because it won't *turn better*.

But there should be something attached to a social heritage that makes us believe in magic. In certain cases it can be related with syncretism due the colonization and imposition of western culture over pre-colombus cultures in America –talking of America as continent. Probably –and I'm speculating with this– that magical heritage is what leads us to search rituals in foreign religions to fulfill a gap that determinism can't address.
